Your project might require the remote CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations to use the ASMX service.

To see the example on how to achieve this behavior, refer to [this project](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net/tree/master/grid-web-service-crud). It is available in the [GitHub repository for Kendo UI examples that use ASP.NET Web technologies](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net).
