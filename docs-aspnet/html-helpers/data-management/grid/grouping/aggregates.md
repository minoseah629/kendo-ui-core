# Aggregates

The Grid enables you to display aggregated number results when the user groups its data.

To enable grouping with aggregate functions, use the `DataSource.Aggregates()`, `ClientGroupFooterTemplate()`, `ClientGroupHeaderColumnTemplate()`, or `ClientFooterTemplate()` methods of the Grid, and the `group` and `aggregate` fields of its data source. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using aggregate functions in the Grid](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/grid/aggregates).
