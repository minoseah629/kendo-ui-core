# Data Source Binding

The Spreadsheet supports binding individual sheets to a Data Source instance which allows you to quickly bring data from external data sources into the Spreadsheet and edit it.  

For a runnable example, refer to the demo on [binding the Spreadsheet HtmlHelper to the DataSource](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/spreadsheet/datasource). The Spreadsheet DataSource from that example uses the [`read`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/datasource/configuration/transport.read) and [`submit`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/datasource/configuration/transport.submit) transport options. The `submit` option is required to properly handle a scenario in which the user creates, updates and deletes items simultaneously.

When using separate [`create`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/datasource/configuration/transport.create), [`update`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/datasource/configuration/transport.update), and [`destroy`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/datasource/configuration/transport.destroy) handlers, it is possible that one of them fails, while the others do not. That will result in a mismatch of the data state between the client (the Spreadsheet) and the remote source. The `submit` option handles all operations within a single request. It will not save any changes if any of the items is invalid.

## Specific Behavior

Data Source binding switches the sheet to a special data-bound mode. It differs from the standard behavior in the following ways:

* Column headers are inferred from the data item fields. Configure the column headers and ordering by using the [sheet `setDataSource` method](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/spreadsheet/sheet/methods/setdatasource).
* Cell styles, formulas, and formats are not persisted in the data source.
* Row height and column width are not persisted in the data source.
* Sorting and filtering are applied locally.

CRUD operations are also handled in a specific way:

* Inserted rows are always appended at the end, regardless of the actual row index.
* Updating cell content translates into update operations.
* Deleting rows translates into destroy operations.
* Inserting and removing columns is not supported.

## Unsupported Scenarios

* The Sheet cannot be bound to a source which does not contain any items because the header row in the sheet is generated based on the data items fields.
* Records cannot be edited after sorting the sheet ([related feature request](https://feedback.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/1402815-allow-sorting-for-spreadsheet-with-datasource)).
* Records cannot be edited after filtering the sheet ([related feature request](https://feedback.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/1402817-allow-filtering-for-spreadsheet-with-datasource)).
