# Aggregates

The TreeList enables you to display aggregated number results when the user groups its data.

To enable grouping with aggregate functions, use the `DataSource.Aggregates()`, `ClientGroupFooterTemplate()`, `ClientGroupHeaderColumnTemplate()`, or `ClientFooterTemplate()` methods of the TreeList, and the `aggregate` fields of its data source. For a runnable example, refer to the [demo on using aggregate functions in the TreeList](https://demos.telerik.com/{{ site.platform }}/treelist/aggregates).
