# Razor Pages Integration

All Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core components are compatible with the ASP.NET Razor Pages framework.

## Scaffolding Templates

You can scaffold a Razor Pages sample which contains an ASP.NET Core Grid with enabled CRUD operations by using the Telerik UI Create New Project Wizard. To get started with the Wizard, refer to the article on [creating projects]({% slug newprojectwizards_visualstudio_aspnetcore %}).

## Sample Applications

The sample Razor Pages samples which demonstrate the usage of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core components are located in the [ASP.NET Core Examples](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-core-examples) repository on GitHub.

## Known Limitations

Razor Pages use `Page` in their routing mechanism which interferes with `GET` requests made by the Kendo UI DataSource. As a result, only `POST` requests should be used when paging is required.
