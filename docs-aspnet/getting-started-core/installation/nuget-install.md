# Installing with NuGet

Telerik maintains a NuGet Feed for registered users.

[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) is a popular .NET package manager. Official releases and service packs of UI for ASP.NET Core are available for registered users.

## The Telerik Private NuGet Feed

To use the Telerik NuGet Feed as a Package Source, use the [NuGet CLI](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/Command-Line-Reference). As of now, Visual Studio does not provide a UI for configuring authenticated NuGet feeds.

### Setting Up the NuGet Package Source

1. Download the [latest NuGet executable](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe).
1. Open a command prompt and change the path to where the `nuget.exe` is downloaded.
1. Depending on your scenario, execute the following commands respectively.

  * To store encrypted credentials, use the `NuGet Sources Add -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password"` command. As a result, a token is stored in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file. Your original credentials cannot be obtained from this token.

    > If you are unable to connect to the feed by using encrypted credentials, try the alternative approach of storing credentials in clear text.

  * To store credentials in clear text, use the `NuGet Sources Add -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password" -StorePasswordInClearText` command. As a result, the password is stored in clear text in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file. If you are unable to connect to the feed using encrypted credentials, use this alternative approach.

    If you have already stored a token instead of storing the credentials as clear text, update the definition in the `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config` file by using the `NuGet Sources Update -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" -UserName "your login email" -Password "your password" -StorePasswordInClearText` command.

### Installing the NuGet Packages

After setting up the source, install the packages either through the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/Package-Manager-Console) or through the [Package Manager Dialog](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-dialog).

## List of Provided Packages

The NuGet feed provides the following packages related to UI for ASP.NET Core and UI for ASP.NET MVC:

- `Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Core`&mdash;Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Commercial.
- `Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Core.Trial`&mdash;Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Trial.

For more information on the list of the provided Kendo UI packages, refer to the article on [installing Kendo UI for jQuery with NuGet](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/intro/installation/nuget-install).

## Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions for common issues you might encounter while using the Kendo UI NuGet feed.

### After changing my Telerik password, I get [Telerik Nuget] The V2 feed at '...' returned an unexpected status code '401 Logon failed.' error

After changing your Telerik password, you need to reset your credentials in the `NuGet.config` file. To do this, run the `NuGet Sources Update -Name "telerik.com" -Source "https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget" -UserName "your login email" -Password "your new password"` command.

The password must contain only ASCII characters.

### The NuGet package takes too long to install or update on Visual Studio

* Disable the auto-sync in the `_references.js` file by modifying the following `/// <autosync enabled="false" />` line.
* You can also disconnect the project from the source control before running the Update Wizard.
