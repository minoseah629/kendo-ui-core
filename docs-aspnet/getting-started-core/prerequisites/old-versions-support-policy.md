> For best performance results, use the latest Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core versions which contain all recent features and fixes that are available.

## Bug Fixes

Bugs in Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core helpers or the Kendo UI for jQuery widgets they wrap are fixed depending on the priority set by the product management and based on the [public Feedback portal](https://feedback.telerik.com/aspnet-core-ui), [support system](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets/available-support-list.aspx), surveys, interviews, and other means at management discretion.

Bug fixes are then implemented in the product by the Development team and later introduced in the first [official product release](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-core-ui/release-history). Internal (nightly) builds may also contain bug fixes before an official release is available and you can use them to keep developing your application. However, avoid promoting them to production.

To get a bug fix, you have to upgrade your project to the same release as the release that contains the fix, or later. For more information, refer to [Downloading New Versions]({% slug latestversionretrieval_visualstudio_aspnetcore %}).

If a workaround for an earlier version is technically feasible, you may be provided with such in the ticketing system. However, Progress Software Corporation cannot guarantee that bug fixes in earlier versions will be available and cannot give warranty for any workarounds that are provided.

## New Features and Helpers

Feature enhancements and new helpers become publicly available in the first major release and after their implementation by the Development team.

New features and helpers are not available for versions which come before the first version in which they were released.

## Browser Compatibility

Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core versions support only browsers that were available at the time of their release.

## Implementation Support

For earlier versions, you can get suggestions on how to implement certain scenarios and features in your project in the ticketing system and depending on their technical feasibility. If such an implementation relies on the API, fixes, or enhancements that are implemented in later versions, you will need to upgrade to a release which contains the feature you need.
