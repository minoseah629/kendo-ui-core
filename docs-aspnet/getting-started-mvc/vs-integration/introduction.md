# Visual Studio Integration Overview

The Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for ASP.NET MVC Visual Studio (VS) Extensions enhance the experience in developing MVC web applications with Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC.

The extensions handle the following major points:

* Project [Creation]({% slug newprojectwizards_visualstudio_aspnetmvc %}) and [Configuration]({% slug projectwizardconfig_visualstudio_aspnetmvc %}) Wizards&mdash;Web asset management, adding the required settings to `web.config`, changing the theme.
* Project [Upgrade]({% slug projectwizardupgrade_visualstudio_aspnetmvc %})&mdash;Upgrading Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC to a new version.

The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC VS Extensions are distributed with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC installer. They support VS 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019, which handle ASP.NET MVC 4 and 5 applications.

> VS Express editions are not supported.

The VS Extensions can be accessed through the **Telerik | Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC** menu which has different menu items depending on the selected project in VS. Additionally, the extensions can be accessed through the Solution Explorer context menu of any supported ASP.NET MVC Web Application projects.
