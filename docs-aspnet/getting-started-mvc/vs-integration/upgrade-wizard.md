# Upgrading Projects

This article demonstrates how to upgrade a Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for ASP.NET MVC application.

## The Basics

The Upgrade Project Wizard upgrades existing Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC applications.

To open the wizard, click **Telerik** > **Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC** > **Upgrade Wizard**.

## Files for Upgrade

The **Information Page** of the Upgrade Project Wizard describes the files and assemblies that are going to be upgraded.

## Projects for Upgrade

On the next page, the Wizard lists all projects from the solution that use Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC. This enables you to choose the projects that will be updated and the version to which they will be upgraded.

It is recommended to upgrade all projects to the selected version. The Compatibility button will invoke the [Upgrade API Analyzer tool](https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/vs-integration/upgrade-api-analyzer):

> The listed projects target all MVC versions that are supported. When you complete the Wizard, all selected projects will be updated.
